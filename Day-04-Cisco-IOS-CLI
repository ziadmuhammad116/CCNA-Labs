Today, I studied the Introduction to Cisco IOS CLI as part of my CCNA journey and gained hands-on experience using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Key concepts and tasks covered:

Understanding User EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and Global Configuration modes

Changing device hostname

Configuring enable password

Using show running-config and show startup-config

Saving configurations and verifying applied changes

Practicing these commands helped me better understand how network devices are configured and managed in real-world environments.

Thanks to @Jeremy’s IT Lab for the clear explanations and practical approach.
